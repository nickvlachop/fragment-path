# Fragment Path

- Fragment path is a project i was making in my spare time over two years , a data structure which stores keys and values , written and to be used in **C language**.  
- This data structure began as an idea to make a heap that stores keys by fragmenting them into a couple pieces and then , creating a unique path for every key using their pieces  
- This idea was develeoped to  
  1. Store keys using as little memory as posible
  2. Store , find and delete keys as indepedent of the number of stored keys as possible
  3. Support multiple threads which can perfrom all of the basic functionality *conqurently*

The headers contain all the infromation a developer needs to know in order to use the fragment path
